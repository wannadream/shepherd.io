<h2 id="detention-bail-parole">Detention, Bail, and Parole</h2>
<h4 id="detention-bail-parole-ig">In General</h4>
<p>
  The custody of a noncitizen against whom a deportation proceeding was pending was an important feature of the Attorney Generals discretionary power. Court proceedings challenging the exercise of that power illustrated the patterns of review when arbitrary action was charged. Beginning with the Internal Security Act of 1950, the statute specifically granted to the Attorney General discretion in determining whether to release a noncitizen on bail. Before then the issue was in doubt. Subsequent amendments to the INA provide that discretionary decisions related to detention are not subject to judicial review. However, courts have continued to find habeas jurisdiction to hear challenges to various detention provisions. See 104.13[6][g][ii] and 108.05, below. See also 104.04[3][d], above.
</p>
<p>
  The discussion that follows pertains to detention, bail, and parole issues before enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA), and the REAL ID Act of 2005.
</p>
<h4 id="detention-bail-parole-pdd">Pending Determination of Deportability</h4>
<p>
  The INA previously specified that a noncitizen apprehended in deportation proceedings might, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be continued in custody or released on bail or parole. Obviously, the denial of bail in deportation proceedings was an extreme exercise of power, and should have been compared with the more lenient rule in criminal cases, in which the privilege of bail is safeguarded by the Eighth Amendment. The menace of Communism in the years following World War II led to increased severity in refusing bail to a comparatively small group of respondents in deportation proceedings. However, under the impact of decisions and suggestions by the courts, the administrative officers tended to adopt a less severe approach. The noncitizen was infrequently arrested during the pendency of deportation proceedings. And those arrested were seldom denied bail.
</p>
<p>
  However, a significant departure from this policy began with the enactment in 1988 of a statutory provision requiring the refusal of release on bail of noncitizens convicted of an aggravated felony. The constitutional challenges to this statute, and its amendment in 1990, which permitted discretionary release on bail of aggravated felons who were lawful permanent residents, have been discussed in Chapters 71 and 72 above.
</p>
<p>
  In Carlson v. Landon the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950 authorizing the Attorney General to deny bail in deportation cases, finding that this legislation did not offend the Fifth or Eighth Amendment. However, the Court concluded that the Attorney Generals exercise of discretion in such cases was subject to a limited judicial scrutiny, and could be overturned only on a showing of clear abuse by demonstrating that the order was without reasonable foundation.
</p>
<p>
  The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 declared that the Attorney Generals orders regarding detention pending final determination of deportability could be reviewed by a court of competent jurisdiction upon a conclusive showing in habeas corpus proceedings that the Attorney General is not proceeding with reasonable dispatch. However, the courts ruled that the 1952 Act did not alter the then-existing standards of review.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, bond decisions were not considered part of the final deportation order and thus were not directly reviewable in a U.S. court of appeals. However, continued detention while review proceedings were pending could be challenged by habeas corpus or review proceedings in the manner previously described. And the statutory reference to habeas corpus did not preclude a district court action for a declaratory judgment and injunction challenging a pattern and practice to impose no work riders for all release bonds in deportation proceedings.
</p>
<p>
  Since the Attorney Generals actions were presumptively lawful, the noncitizen had the burden to support any charges of arbitrariness. In the absence of such a showing the courts would not disturb the Attorney Generals order.
</p>
<p>
  Such challenges arose primarily in the cases of noncitizens charged with subversive activity. The courts held that the Attorney General could deny bail to active members of the Communist Party. However, when there was no showing of recent Communist activity, denial of bail was deemed arbitrary. And a court struck down as arbitrary the denial of bail on the ground that the noncitizen had refused to answer the questions of a congressional committee, holding that such refusal evoked no inference of recent activity. The denial of bail on the basis of confidential security information, revealed to the court in camera, was upheld. The rearrest of a noncitizen previously released on bail was held not to be arbitrary if supported by adequate reasons.
</p>
<p>
  An obvious justification for the denial of bail or for fixing high bail existed when there was a reasonable basis for suspecting that the noncitizen would flee. When this finding was supported by an evaluation of the noncitizens unstable situation in the United States (e.g., a deserting seaman or a recently arrived stowaway) or history of past unreliability, the denial of bail was not arbitrary, particularly when it appeared that the Attorney General was proceeding with reasonable dispatch and that deportation was imminent.
</p>
<p>
  Bail also had been denied on some occasions when the noncitizen was notoriously identified with criminal activities or associations. We have previously noted the inauguration in 1988 of a statutory provision requiring the denial of bail to noncitizens convicted of aggravated felonies. However, the extent to which this power could be used under such circumstances was previously questionable. In one case the court nullified an order denying bail to an individual of some notoriety previously convicted for evading military service. Moreover, in the absence of any indication that respondent was a bail or security risk, there was no justification for arresting the respondent or imposing bail merely because he had refused to answer questions. Indeed, the statutory provision requiring the denial of bail to noncitizens convicted of aggravated felonies had been declared unconstitutional by several courts. After the enactment of new mandatory detention provisions, and bars to judicial review, courts have found limited jurisdiction to hear challenges to mandatory detention provisions in habeas proceedings. See 104.04[3][d], above, and 108.05, below.
</p>
<p>
  The same standards of review previously governed other aspects of the Attorney Generals exercise of power in relation to detention. Thus, the courts reviewed the conditions fixed for parole or release on bail and nullified them if found to be arbitrary. For example, when the bail was unreasonably high the courts intervened to assure reasonable bail usually the amount fixed did not exceed $5,000. A refusal to accept as surety an organization whose previous actions led to a reasonable supposition that it was unreliable was held proper. However, it was found improper to refuse bail solely because the proposed surety was a member of a subversive organization.
</p>
<p>
  An attack upon an order denying bail pending determination of deportability became moot when the final administrative order was entered. But another court found that the Attorney Generals power continued during court review on the merits. Moreover, the Attorney Generals authority to control the noncitizens custody during deportation proceedings was not affected by grant of bail or parole in a criminal proceeding.
</p>
<p>
  Courts generally did not intercede in disputes concerning the place of detention or detention conditions. However, noncitizens could challenge the exercise of such discretionary authority arbitrarily or in violation of constitutional protections.
</p>
<h4 id="detention-bail-parole-afdd">After Final Determination of Deportability</h4>
<p>
  The immigration statute previously directed that for a period of six months after the final administrative or judicial determination of deportability the Attorney General, in his or her discretion, could detain the noncitizen or release him or her on bail or parole. While the entry of the final order drastically changed the noncitizens situation, the courts held that the same standard of review prevailed. However, the reasonableness of an order denying bail may have depended on the likelihood of carrying out the deportation. When there was no reasonable expectation of deportation within the six-month period, the denial of bail was arbitrary. On the other hand, courts did not deem the denial of bail unreasonable when there was some hope that deportation could be accomplished.
</p>
<p>
  We note again that changed administrative policies and procedures in the past had diminished detentions of noncitizens under deportation proceedings. Therefore, relatively few cases involving such detentions arose in the courts.
</p>
<p>
  The Attorney General had no authority to continue detention beyond the six-month period, and the courts required release after such period expired. Consequently, cases in which detentions after the final deportation order were attacked almost invariably became moot while appellate proceedings were pending in the courts, since the allowable six-month period for detention was not extended by judicial review of bail. But release was not authorized when detention was prolonged beyond the six-month period by delays of the noncitizens own making. The statute also did not permit the exaction of bail after the expiration of the six-month period. The only sanction was parole supervision. Moreover, such an order of supervision was subject to judicial review and any conditions imposed that did not relate to assuring availability for deportation were found unreasonable.
</p>
<h4 id="detention-bail-parole-ec">Exclusion Cases</h4>
<p>
  The immigration statute had no provision for release on bail pending a final determination of a noncitizen’s admissibility to the United States. Therefore, there was no right to bail and a limited basis for review in the courts.
</p>
<p>
  In many instances, such noncitizens were permitted to enter the United States under parole while their admissibility was under consideration. The denial of parole and the reasonableness of the terms of such parole could be a basis for judicial inquiry. Moreover, prolonged detention under an exclusion order, after efforts to return the noncitizen to his or her own country had been fruitless, might have been subject to judicial attack as punitive and arbitrary. Another appellate court ruled, however, that the Attorney General has implicit authority to detain rather than parole an excluded noncitizen who cannot be returned to his own country, and that judicial review of his decision is narrow.
</p>
<h2 id="detention">Detention</h2>
<h4 id="detention-nshpd">Noncitizens Subject to Highest Priority for Detention</h4>
<p>The DHS places the highest priority on apprehending and detaining the following categories of noncitizens:</p>
<ul class="style1">
  <li>those engaged in or suspected of terrorism or espionage, or who otherwise pose a danger to national security;</li>
  <li>those apprehended at the border or ports of entry while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States;</li>
  <li>those convicted of an offense for which an element was active participation in a criminal street gang, as defined in 18
    U.S.C. § 521(a), or those at least sixteen years old who intentionally participated in an organized criminal gang to
    further the illegal activity of the gang;</li>
  <li>those convicted of an offense classified as a felony in the convicting jurisdiction, other than a state or local offense
    for which an essential element was the individual’s immigration status; and</li>
  <li>those convicted of an “aggravated felony,” as that term is defined in the INA at the time of the conviction.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="detention-nsshpd">Noncitizens Subject to Second Highest Priority for Detention</h4>
<p>The DHS places its next highest priority on the apprehension and detention of:</p>
<ul class="style1">
  <li>those convicted of three or more misdemeanor offenses arising out of three separate incidents, other than minor traffic
    offenses or state or local offenses for which an essential element was the person’s immigration status;</li>
  <li>those convicted of a “significant misdemeanor,” (defined as an offense of domestic violence, sexual abuse or exploitation,
    burglary, unlawful possession or use of a firearm, drug distribution or trafficking, or driving under the influence)
    or a misdemeanor for which the person was sentenced to ninety days or more in custody (not including a suspended sentence);</li>
  <li>those apprehended anywhere in the United States after unlawfully entering or re-entering the country and who cannot establish
    that they have been continuously physically present since January 1, 2014; and</li>
  <li>those who have significantly abused the visa or visa waiver programs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="detention-nslpd">Noncitizens Subject to Lowest Priority for Detention</h4>
<p>
  The DHS places its lowest priority on the apprehension and detention of those who have been issued a final order of removal
  after 2013 and who do not otherwise fall into Priority 1 or 2.
</p>
<h4 id="detention-nwsnbd">Noncitizens Who Should Not Be Detained</h4>
<p>
  The 2014 memorandum instructs DHS personnel not to expend detention resources on specific classes of vulnerable noncitizens,
  absent extraordinary circumstances or the requirements of mandatory detention:
</p>
<ul class="style1">
  <li>those known to be suffering from serious physical or mental illness;</li>
  <li>those who are disabled, elderly, pregnant, or nursing;</li>
  <li>those who are the primary caretakers or children or an infirm person; and</li>
  <li>those whose detention is otherwise not in the public interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  DHS personnel must obtain approval from the relevant ICE field office director to detain noncitizens in these specified vulnerable
  categories. Further, they are encouraged to contact their local Office of Chief Counsel for guidance if a noncitizen in
  the specified vulnerable categories is subject to mandatory detention.
</p>
<h4 id="detention-insd">Identification of Noncitizens Subject to Detention</h4>
<p>
  The DOJ and DHS are authorized to identify noncitizens that are subject to discretionary and mandatory detention and have
  exercised this authority in a number of ways. The INA requires the Attorney General to create and institute a system that
  identifies noncitizens that have been charged with or convicted of aggravated felonies within the United States.
</p>
<p>
  The INA requires the Attorney General to focus on three methods of identification. First, the Attorney General must make
  available to federal, state, and local authorities the resources of the immigration agency to determine whether individuals
  arrested for aggravated felonies are noncitizens. Second, the Attorney General must designate immigration employees to
  serve as liaisons to federal, state, and local authorities regarding the arrest, conviction, and release of any noncitizen
  charged with an aggravated felony. Third, the Attorney General must maintain a current, computerized record of noncitizens
  who have been convicted of aggravated felonies and those who have been removed. Although it appears that the statute requires
  the Attorney General to maintain a record only of noncitizens removed due to aggravated-felony convictions, it may also
  require a record to be kept of noncitizens removed for any other reason.
</p>
<p>
  The computerized record must be available to inspectors at ports of entry and to Border Patrol agents so they may identify
  any noncitizen previously ordered removed. The record must also be provided to the Department of State for use in its automated
  visa lookout system.
</p>
<p>
  In response to a request from a chief executive officer of any State, the Attorney General must provide assistance to state
  courts in identifying noncitizens unlawfully present in the United States pending criminal prosecution.
</p>
<p>
  The Attorney General initially implemented the authority under the INA in part by coordinating with the Federal Bureau of
  Investigation (FBI) to establish an Immigration Violator File (IVF) within the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)
  database. The IVF database includes three categories of noncitizens that may be subject to detention. First, the Deported
  Felon File contains records of previously deported felons convicted and deported for drug trafficking, firearm trafficking,
  or serious violent crime. Second, the Absconders File contains records for each individual with an outstanding administrative
  warrant of removal from the United States who has unlawfully remained in the United States. Third, the National Security
  Entry/Exit Registration System (NSEERS) File contains records for individuals who the DHS has determined have violated
  the requirements of the NSEERS. While the NSEERS program was suspended in 2011, its database continues to be available
  to law enforcement personnel.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to their own role in identifying detainable noncitizens, the Justice Department and DHS have increasingly expanded
  the role of state and local agencies in immigration enforcement, including the apprehension and detention of noncitizens.
  The Attorney General is authorized under INA § 287(g), added by the IIRAIRA in 1996, to enter into a written agreement
  with any State or political subdivision of a State, pursuant to which officers or employees of the state or subdivision
  may carry out the identification, apprehension, or detention of noncitizens. Since 2003, ICE has entered into Memoranda
  of Agreement (MOA) with state and local law enforcement agencies for selected personnel from these agencies to carry out
  immigration enforcement activities. The state and local law enforcement agencies have used their authority pursuant to
  the MOAs with ICE to identify noncitizens with criminal convictions who are incarcerated within federal, state, and local
  facilities and to refer these noncitizens to ICE for detention and removal proceedings upon their release.
</p>
<p>
  The ability to identify detainable noncitizens increased exponentially with the implementation and expansion of the DHS’s
  Secure Communities program. Under Secure Communities, the FBI sends all fingerprints that it receives from state and local
  law enforcement agencies to the DHS. The DHS then checks the fingerprints against its various immigration databases to
  identify noncitizens that it decides to put into immigration enforcement actions and take into custody.
</p>
<p>
  DHS discontinued the Secure Communities program in November 2014. DHS established a new program, called the Priority Enforcement
  Program (PEP), which continues to rely on fingerprint checks, but seeks custody only of noncitizens that fall within certain
  current DHS detention priorities. The PEP program discontinues the use of immigration detainers, instead requesting notification
  of pending release of those convicted of specifically listed crimes.
</p>
<p>
  In January 2017, President Trump issued two executive orders effectively ending the PEP program and expanding the 287(g)
  program. Among other things, the executive orders require the DHS to detain as many noncitizens as possible under the law.
  The DHS is supposed to detain people arrested for illegal entry and other violations of immigration law. The orders also
  instruct the DHS to restrict issuing parole to detained individuals.
</p>
<h2 id="final-order-of-removal">Final Order of Removal</h2>
<p>After an immigration judge issues an order of removal, the order will become final under these conditions:</p>
<ul class="style2">
  <li>Waive right to appeal; or</li>
  <li>The 30-day time period to file an appeal expires; or</li>
  <li>The appeal is dismissed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA); or</li>
  <li>The BIA makes a decision to uphold the order of removal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="90-day-custody-review">90-day Custody Review</h2>
<p>
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has 90 days to deport the person after his/her final order of removal is issued.
  If ICE fails to remove him/her within 90 days, upon 90-day custody review, they may decide that the deportation is reasonably
  foreseeable, and may hold him/her for another 90 days, since the law gives ICE six months to execute removal. This does
  not mean that ICE will release you automatically after six months.
</p>
<h2 id="180-day-custody-review">180-day Custody Review</h2>
<p>
  Once the person has been detained for six months (180 days) after his/her final order of removal, he/she becomes eligible
  to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus demanding release from detention. This petition does not change the immigration
  status of the person. He/She still has a final order of removal on his/her name. The petition is merely a request for release
  from detention. If the petitioner does not have a lawyer, he/she can file a motion for appointment of counsel. If the petitioner
  does not have money to pay the filing fee of habeas petition, he/she can file a motion to proceed in forma pauperis.
</p>

Legal and Constitutional facts and factors issues, pursuant to Statutory and Regulatory authorities unique to this Court which require careful review and analysis and research and shall resolve all and any uncertainty that is warranted and that is plenary.
      Specifically, Petitioner raises the question before this Court, is whether Petitioner has made a showing "that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future," and, if so, whether the Government has sufficiently rebutted that showing. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701. Petitioner has satisfied the first and second prong of the standard, he falls within the category as required. Specifically, Petitioner has good reason to believe his assertion, that there is no likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future has merits. DHS Policy and regulations are essentially undisputed binding on federal law and regulations authority. Petitioner urges this Court for equal judicial procedural safeguard protection consideration in his Case on the whole. This Court is saddled with evidentiary and ensuring that the process complies with due process requirements.

      The government shall research the relevant legal and regulations fact and issues, consult with agency counsel, and consider a serious administrative remedy litigation strategy; that must affect the outcome of Petitioner’s case, given government’s contradictory and disputed evidence binding on matters of fact and law pursuant to federal law and regulations authorities. Specifically, Petitioner as framed his pleadings and arguments exclusively on the Second Circuit, "Zadvydas thus 'articulates the outer bounds of the Government's ability to detain aliens...without jeopardizing their due process rights.'"

Petitioner submits that, however, despite the seemingly broad applicability of Zadvydas to all Immigration detentions, those that fall within Section 1231 appear to be subject to a somewhat different constitutional analysis.`, {

Specifically, Petitioner challenge the Constitutionality of his confinement under 28 U.S.C. 2241, where Attorney General has held him for over 6 months without an individualized determination of whether he is a Flight Risk or a Danger to the Community. 
      Finally, the Supreme Court has held that where Congress intends to preclude Judicial Review of Constitutional claims, its intent to do so must be clear. . . And, where a provision precluding review is claimed to bar Habeas Review, the Court has required a particularly clear statement that such is Congress' intent. Section 1226(e) contains no explicit provision barring Habeas Review and the Court thinks that its clear text does not bar Petitioner’s Constitutional challenge to the Legislation authorizing his detention without bail.

Respondent raises and contends that, 8 U.S.C. § 1231 authorizes the Government to detain- Petitioner this long ­ and apparently for longer- seeing how the clock will keep ticking ­ without an individualized determination of whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community.
       Petitioner has filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, in which he argues (1) that Mandatory Detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1231 does not apply to him as a Statutory matter, and (2) even if it does, detaining him for such a prolonged period of time without a bond hearing Violates Due Process and the remedy Petitioner requests from the Habeas Petition is an Order directing Respondent to afford him a bond hearing in the alternative Supervise Conditional Release. 
    However, as part of the analysis on the Motion for bail; this Court shall recommend that Petitioner is substantially likely to succeed on the merits of his habeas petition. This Court shall further respectfully recommend that the proper remedy would be to grant the habeas petition, or specifically order the Immigration Court to hold a prompt bond hearing with instructions.

    doc.font('Helvetica').text(`       Title 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) gives the Attorney General ninety (90) days to remove an alien from the United States after an order of removal. During this ninety (90) day period, detention is mandatory. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a). At the end of the ninety (90) day period, ICE may continue to hold the alien, or it may grant supervised release. 8 U.S.C. §§1231(a) (3) & (6). The discretion to detain an alien under § 1231(a). Supra Les Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693-94, 121 S. Ct. 2491, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2001). As the Supreme Court explained in Zadvydas:  When an alien has been found to be unlawfully present in the United States and a final order of removal has been entered, the Government ordinarily secures the alien's removal during a subsequent 90-day statutory "removal period," during which time the alien normally is held in custody. Moreover, a Special Statute authorizes further Detention if the Government fails to remove the Alien during those 90 days. It says:  "An alien ordered removed [1] who is inadmissible ... [2][or] removable [as a result of violations of Status requirements or entry Conditions, Violations of Criminal Law, or reasons of Security or Foreign Policy] or [3] who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the Community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to [certain] terms of supervision...." 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V). Which is not the Petitioner’s case on the merits?
      Under Zadvydas Court observed, the relevant statute distinguishes three categories of aliens. In that Case, the Court considered whether the "post-removal-period statute authorizes the Attorney General to detain a removable alien [i.e., the second category of alien who was lawfully admitted, but subsequently violated a condition of admission] indefinitely beyond the removal period or only for a period reasonably necessary to secure the alien's removal. “Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 682 (emphasis in original). Employing the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, the Court held that the statute implicitly authorizes continued detention for a presumptively reasonable six-month period. Id. at 701. Cites in Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 378, 125 S. Ct. 716, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2005), a case considering the post-removal order detention of two Mariel Cubans, the Court applied its holding in Zadvydas to all three categories of aliens in § 1231(a)(6):  Under operative language of § 1231(a) (6), "may be detained beyond the removal period," applies without differentiation to all three categories of aliens that are its subject. To give these same words a different meaning for each category would be to invent a statute rather than interpret one. As the Court in Zadvydas recognized, the statute can be construed "literally" to authorize indefinite detention, id., at 689, 533 U.S. 678, 121 S. Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653, or (as the Court ultimately held) it can be read to "suggest [less than] unlimited discretion" to detain, id., at 697, 533 U.S. 678, 121 S. Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653. It cannot, however, be interpreted to do both at the same time.
      Finally, in the wake of Zadvydas, but prior to Clark, the Attorney General promulgated a set of regulations designed to narrow the scope of his authority to detain aliens beyond the post-removal order period in order to comply with the Supreme Court's decision. See 8 C.F.R. §§241.13, 241.14.

    doc.font('Helvetica').text(`       The core issue is whether there is a determination that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. Because Petitioner has establish that the Department is incapable of removing him to ${sheep.nationality} in the reasonably foreseeable future, Petitioner asserted that his "ongoing detention [was] in violation of Zadvydas" because the "six month presumptively reasonable removal period" expired on ${sheep.dateOfFinalOrderOfRemoval.toLocaleDateString("en-US")}, and "there [was] no significant likelihood of getting authentic travel documents now or in [the] foreseeable future from the ${sheep.nationality} [] Consulate. Petitioner argues that his continued detention "contravene[d] 8 U.S.C. [§] 1231(a) (6)" and violated his rights to substantive and procedural due process. Petitioner has satisfied the many procedural prerequisites previously discussed are entitled to relief. 
       In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 125 S. Ct. 716, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2005), that the post-removal period detention of two inadmissible aliens from Cuba who had not effected "entry" was no longer statutorily authorized by § 1231(a)(6) because removal to Ghana was not reasonably foreseeable. See id. at 384. 
    The aliens "were detained well beyond six months after their removal orders became final," and the government "brought forward nothing to indicate that a substantial likelihood of removal subsists despite the passage of six months (indeed, it concedes that it is no longer even involved in repatriation negotiations with ${sheep.nationality}) (the government normal uses the reasonably foreseeable future argument as a strategy through the game of continue detention delay manipulation ambush." Id. at 386. Under these circumstances, this Court should hold to and reinforce that the petition for habeas corpus should be granted.

    doc.font('Helvetica').text(`      Section 1231 governs the detention, release and removal of aliens ordered removed, and gives the Attorney General 90 days to accomplish removal following the entry of a final removal. 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) (1) (A). If removal cannot be effectuated within the 90-day period, the statute permits certain aliens-including aliens such as Petitioner-to be “detained beyond the removal period.” Id. 1231(a) (6); see also Akinwale v. Ashcroft, 287 F.3d 1050, 1051(11th Cir. 2002).
    The “removal period” begins to run upon the last of one of three events:
    (i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.
    (ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court’s final order.
    (iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process), the date the alien is released from detention or confinement. 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) (1) (B) (i)-(iii).
      The Supreme Court further addressed 1231 in Zadvydas and held that 1231(a) authorizes detention for a period reasonably necessary to accomplish an alien’s removal. 533 U.S. at 701. The Supreme Court determined that six months is a presumptively reasonable period of time to allow the government to remove an alien after the removal period has commenced. Id. at 701. Once the six month period has lapsed, and “the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, [then] the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.” Id.; see also Akinwale, 287 F.3d at 1052(alien must show “post-removal order detention in excess of six months” and “evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably future”).
      Particularly relevant here, however, is that any analysis under 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) and Zadvydas is subject to 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(C), which provides that the 90-day removal period under 1231(a) may be suspended, and thereby extended, where “the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien’s departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien’s removal subject to an order of removal.” 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) (1) (C).

Dep't of Homeland Sec., 535 F.3d 942, 951 (9th Cir. 2008), the Ninth Circuit considered whether a person could ask for a bond while he was appealing his case to the Ninth Circuit and had been granted a stay of removal. The Ninth Circuit held that, even if the person was not previously eligible for a bond because of his criminal history, his prolonged detention meant that he was eligible to have a bond hearing before an Immigration Judge unless ICE “establishes that he is a flight risk or will be a danger to the community.” In Diouf v.Napolitano, 634 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir. 2011), the Ninth Circuit also held that a person who had filed a motion to reopen and appealed it to the Ninth Circuit could ask for a bond hearing after 6 months. This Court should conclude that a proposed fact is undisputed and the government explicitly should not dispute violations of not complying with its own policy and regulations by identifying significantly its own travel document request requirements contradictory policy and regulations evidence in the record, and demonstrates Petitioner’s proponent of the fact does warrants this petition
      This Court shall exclusively apply Statutory and Regulatory Authorities analysis to Petitioner’s detention, the evidence reflects that there is a no significant likelihood that Petitioner will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. Moreover, because it is unclear whether repatriation is likely, this Court shall defer ruling on Petitioner’s Zadvydas claim, pending further discovery. Further, certification is appropriate because Petitioner is seeking relief as a result of Government’s action that applies uniformly to Petitioner in custody. Further, his pleadings and arguments are sufficiently numerous; present common questions of law and facts; assert claims that will fairly and adequately represent his claims. Even if his removal is reasonably foreseeable, his detention has become unreasonably prolonged. This unreasonable detention entitles him to a bond hearing before an impartial adjudicator, such as an Immigration Judge, to determine whether Petitioner is a flight risk or danger to the community. Further, even if ${sheep.nationality}’s Government has agreed to accept repatriation of Petitioner, his removal is still not significantly likely in reasonably foreseeable future, because it could take years to litigate his Administrative remedies. If Petitioner is denied at every stage of the litigation, from the Immigration Judge to the Court of Appeals, the process can take nearly three years. 
       Finally, ICE declarations is not based on each Declarants personal knowledge, but something each declarant calls their “professional knowledge”-a term ICE declarants does not define and not something that appears to support supposedly factual statements in an affidavit or declaration.

Lin v Ashcroft (2003, ED Pa). Where alien established that there was no significant likelihood of removal in reasonably foreseeable future based on Petitioner's pleadings and arguments, ${sheep.nationality} refused to issue travel documents, alien's continued detention for unreasonable period after expiration of removal period set out in 8 USCS § 1231(a) (1) was unwarranted; government merely speculated Petitioner's Country of origin regularly issued travel documents, especially under threat with successful removal in the past. 
      Specifically, in cases in which: (1) alien had been detained by Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement for three months longer than presumptively reasonable period set forth in Zadvydas decision, (2) alien provided good reason to believe that there was no significant likelihood of his removal in reasonably foreseeable future, (3) government failed to carry its burden of rebutting showing, and (4) alien had shown good faith in cooperating with government to effectuate his removal from United State. In Decision to Continue Detention that Immigration officials were continuing to work with representatives of the ${sheep.nationality} Consulate to effect his removal, and that travel documents authorizing Petitioner’s removal from the United States to ${sheep.nationality}, which was anticipated to be received in the foreseeable future is substantially speculative and conjectured by government for sole and exclusive purpose, of game of significant likelihood of his removal in reasonable foreseeable future manipulation ambush. See ${sheep.nationality} Government Response with regards to the Government Requests records Exhibits.
      Specifically, findings regarding the diligence of Immigration efforts to promptly remove the Petitioner and the likelihood of his removal in the foreseeable future were further underscored by other Immigration records. These records revealed that Immigration officials had contacted the ${sheep.nationality} consulate in ${sheep.iceReqTravelDocStartDate}   to secure travel documents for the Petitioner. (Id.) On at least one occasion, Immigration officials were informed by ${sheep.nationality} consular officers that they "are uncertain in regards [Petitioner's travel document] by now and expect[ed] it not at any time soon." (Id.) Thus, while ${sheep.nationality} officials have delayed in securing such documents, this information shall be recorded in the Immigration records and shall suggest that travel documents will not be forthcoming any time soon. Moreover, the ${sheep.nationality} consulate has stated that they "are not expected to receive it any time soon either [Petitioner’s travel document]. 
        Finally, in this case, Petitioner's post-removal detention has now exceeded this mandatory 90-day detention period, and is 6 months in duration. Having exceeded the mandatory statutory post-removal detention period, Petitioner's continuing Immigration detention pending removal now, begins to implicate a series of other legal and constitutional considerations. For aliens awaiting removal, like Petitioner, the contours of those constitutional considerations are now defined by the United States Supreme Court's decision in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 121 S. Ct. 2491, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2001), and its progeny. Taken together, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) (1) (A) and Zadvydas create a statutory and constitutional framework for protecting the rights of aliens who are detained pursuant to administratively final removal orders. Under this framework, such aliens shall be detained for the first 90 days of the removal period. Petitioner argues that further detention beyond this 90-day period will then be presumed reasonable up to a period of 6 months, at which time, once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must either respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing or give the alien bail consideration.

Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 687-688, 121 S. Ct. 2491, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2001). The district where the Petitioner is detained "is the only district that has jurisdiction to entertain a defendant's § 2241 petition." Supra Lee v. Wetzel, 244 F. 3d 370, 373-75 (5th Cir. 2001). Petitioner's petition complains of his detention when removal is no longer reasonable foreseeable, and Petitioner is detained in Etowah County Detention Center within the Northern District of Alabama. Therefore, the District Court in Birmingham has jurisdiction over these allegations.
       Petitioner alleges that, he is being unlawfully detained because there is no significant likelihood of his removal to ${sheep.nationality} in the reasonable foreseeable future. Petitioner's continued detention is permissible given his removal is not reasonable foreseeable. Petitioner argues that, "to the contrary, an alien may be held in confinement until it has been determined that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future." Id. at 701. If six months had passed and the alien had demonstrated "no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future," then the government was required to "respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing." Id. If the government could demonstrate a reasonably foreseeable termination point, the detention continued. To support his claim that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future and that, he should be released, Petitioner alleges that he has fully cooperated with deportation officials. Petitioner argues moreover, ICE is "aware" that his return to Petitioner cannot be effectuated in the reasonable foreseeable future.
       Finally, in Clark v. Martinez, supra, the Court extended its interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) (6) to inadmissible aliens. The Court concluded that there was no reason why the period of time reasonably necessary to effect removal would be longer for an inadmissible alien than for an admissible alien. Clark, 543 U.S. at 386, 125 S.Ct. at 727. Thus, it held that the 6-month presumptive detention period prescribed in Zadvydas should be applicable. Id. Accordingly, under Clark and Zadvydas, when an alien shows that he has been held more than six months beyond the removal period and his removal is not reasonably foreseeable, a § 2241 petition should be granted. Clark, 543 U.S. at 386-387, 125 S.Ct. at 727; Benitez v. Wallis, 402 F.3d 1133, 1135 (11th Cir. 2005) (relying on Clark to hold that "an inadmissible alien can no longer be detained beyond the statutory 90-day removal period of § 1231(a) (1), where there was no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.").

After the completion of removal proceedings, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) governs the detention, release, and removal of an alien who has been ordered removed. See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 683 (referring to § 1231 as the "post-removal-period detention statute"). An alien must be detained during the removal period established in § 1231(a) (1).1 Section 1231(a) (6) grants the Attorney General the discretionary authority to detain certain classes of aliens "beyond" the removal period, or to release them subject to terms of supervision in § 1231(a) (3).

In Zadvydas, the Supreme Court held that 1231(a) authorizes detention for a period reasonably necessary to continue detention where it fairly aids the government in its legitimate efforts to remove individuals with final orders of removal. 533 U.S. at 701. The Supreme Court determined that six months is a presumptively reasonable period of time to allow the government to remove an alien after the removal period has commenced.
       Thus, despite the length of Petitioner’s detention here, it is not statutorily permitted by 8 U.S.C. 1231 because it is not consistent with Zadvydas and is in furtherance of the government’s legitimate in effecting orders of removal. Petitioner’s Petition satisfies prong of Zadvydas, his claim is plausible because he does “provide evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Akinwale, 287 F.3d at 1052.

    doc.font('Helvetica').text(`       In Zadvydas, the Supreme Court considered a due process challenge to the detention of aliens under 8 U.S.C. § 1231, which governs detention following a final order of removal. Section 1231(a) (6) provides, among other things, that when an alien who has been ordered removed, is not in fact removed, during the 90-day statutory "removal period, that alien "may be detained beyond the removal period" in the discretion of the Attorney General. Observing that "[a] statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional problem," the Zadvydas Court "interpret[ed] the statute to avoid a serious constitutional threat" by construing section 1231(a) (6) to authorize continued detention of an alien following the 90-day removal period for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the alien's removal. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690, 698-99. The Zadvydas Court determined that six months was the presumptive limit on the "reasonably necessary" period of detention. Id. at 701. "After this 6-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing." Id. If the Government fails to rebut the alien's showing, the alien is entitled to habeas relief. See, e.g., Chun Yat Ma v. Asher, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58082, 2012 WL 1432229, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 25, 2012). Petitioner argues that, in the present case, it appears undisputed that the order of removal became final on ${sheep.dateOfFinalOrderOfRemoval.toLocaleDateString("en-US")} . Therefore, Petitioner's detention has exceeded the 90-day removal period set forth in 8 U.S.C. section 1231(a) (1) and the six-month presumptive period established in Zadvydas. “Zadvydas places the burden on the alien to show, after a detention period of six months, that there is 'good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.'" Pelich v. I.N.S., 329 F.3d 1057, 1059 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). If the alien meets this burden, the government "must introduce evidence to refute that assertion." Id. (citations omitted).
        Courts that have addressed the issue of whether there is a significant likelihood removal of a detainee in the reasonably foreseeable future have found 'no significant likelihood of removal' in four types of cases. One, where no country will accept the detainee, [citation], two, where the detainee's country of origin refuses to issue a travel document for the detainee, [citations], three, where there is no removal agreement between the detainee's country of origin and the U.S., [citation], and four, where there was no definitive answer from the target country after several months as to whether it would issue travel papers for a detainee [citation]. Supra Nma v. Ridge, 286 F.Supp. 2d 469, 475 (E.D. Pa. 2003). Petitioner states that he "understands that the ${sheep.nationality} Consulate has not been able to issue any travel document and he does not know exactly what is the relationship between the United States and ${sheep.nationality} regarding formal or informal agreement between both countries". Petitioner argues and claims, never to have heard "of Iraq accepting citizen [sic] through deportation or removal procedure" (id.). 
        The government have “had 6 months to remove him [sic] from the United States," but has been unable to do so. Moreover, DHS request records shall prove that ${sheep.nationality} has refused to or is unable to issue a travel document for Petitioner. Further, travel documents reportedly through ICE substantial speculation game of manipulation ambush pending assertion and nothing in the record suggests that ${sheep.nationality} will issue travel documents in the reasonably foreseeable future. These circumstances significantly undercut Government claims. Although Petitioner complains of delay, the delay evidently resulted from the fact; months of post-removal-order detention are certainly a considerable length of time. 
        Finally, for all of the foregoing reasons, Petitioner has failed to show "good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future."

       The issue of whether § 1231(a)(6) authorizes the Attorney General to detain a removable alien indefinitely beyond the 90 day removal period was resolved by the Supreme Court in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001). Moreover, recognizing that the indefinite detention of aliens "would raise serious constitutional concerns," the Court concluded that § 1231(a) (6) "limits an alien's post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States. It does not permit indefinite detention." Id. at 689. Furthermore, the Court held that "once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized by statute." Id. at 699. Moreover, the Court recognized six (6) months as a "presumptively reasonable period of detention." Id. at 701. With respect to detention after the six month period, the Court explained:   For detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior post-removal confinement grows, what counts as the "reasonably foreseeable future" conversely would have to shrink. This 6-month presumption, of course, does not mean that every alien not removed must be released after six months. To the contrary, an alien may be held in confinement, until it has been determined that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. Id. (emphasis added). The Court provided the following instructions for the consideration of habeas claims brought by detained aliens complaining of prolonged confinement pending removal:
       The habeas Court must ask whether the detention in question exceeds a period reasonably necessary to secure removal. It should measure reasonableness primarily in terms of the statute's basic purpose, namely assuring the alien's presence at the moment of removal. Thus, if removal is not reasonably foreseeable, the Court should hold continued detention unreasonable and no longer authorized by statute. In that case, of course, the alien's release may and should be conditioned on any of the various forms of supervised release that are appropriate in the circumstances, and the alien may no doubt be returned to custody upon a violation of those conditions. Moreover, if removal is reasonably foreseeable, the habeas Court should consider the risk of the alien's committing further crimes as a factor potentially justifying confinement within that reasonable removal period. Id. at 699-700 (citations omitted). "Thus, if a federal court determines in the habeas action that removal is not 'reasonably foreseeable,' the alien should be released from custody subject to conditions of supervised release that are 'appropriate in the circumstances.'" Supra Seretse-Khama v. Ashcroft, 215 F. Supp. 2d 37, 46 (D. D.C. 2002). After six months of post-final order detention, Zadvydas places the burden on the alien to show that there is "good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future . . .” 533 U.S. at 701. Upon such a showing, ICE "must rebut it to keep him in custody." Supra Abdel-Muhti v. Ashcroft, 314 F. Supp. 2d 418, 424 (M.D. Pa. 2004). 
    Following Zadvydas, the Attorney General promulgated regulations establishing a process for determining the custody of aliens subject to prolonged detention awaiting execution of a removal order. See, 8 C.F.R. § 241.13. Section 241.13 applies to aliens, such as Petitioner, "who are subject to a final order of removal and are detained under the custody review procedures provided at [8 C.F.R.] § 241.4 after the expiration of the removal period. 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(a). Section 241.13 "tracks Zadvydas's mandate in that it requires a deportable alien to first establish a basis that removal in the 'reasonably foreseeable future' is not possible." Jabir v. Ashcroft, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 346, No. Civ. A. 03-2480, 2004 WL 60318, at *5 (E.D. La. Jan. 8, 2004). A detained alien may trigger HQPDU review of whether there is a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future by way of written request. 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(d). Faced with such a request, the HQPDU generally must respond with ten (10) business days, acknowledging receipt of the request for review and explaining the process that will be followed to consider the alien's request. 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(e) (1). The HQPDU must then assess the alien's cooperation with removal efforts and consider a host of other factors, including the history of ICE's "efforts to remove aliens to the country in question or to third countries, . . . the ongoing nature of . . . efforts to remove this alien . . ., the reasonably foreseeable results of those efforts, the views of the Department of State regarding the prospects of a removal of aliens to the country or countries in question, and the receiving country's willingness to accept the alien into its territory." 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(f). The regulations caution that, while "there is no presumptive period of time within which the alien's removal must be accomplished, the prospects of the timeliness of removal must be reasonable under the circumstances." 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(f). The HQPDU is to issue a written decision based upon the administrative record. 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(g). If HQPDU determines that there is no significant likelihood that the alien will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future, the alien is to be released, subject to appropriate conditions, unless "special circumstances" exist. 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(g) (1). 2
       Respondents concede "that Petitioner has been in post-order detention for a period exceeding six months and thus such detention is no longer presumptively reasonable." Moreover, indeed, even after being served with the habeas corpus petition in this case, ICE took no formal action to assess the likelihood of Petitioner removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. Despite the absence of a written determination by HQPDU required by 8 C.F.R. § 241.13, Respondent has failed to show that there is no significant likelihood of his removal within the reasonably foreseeable future. Respondents' argument is without merit. Petitioner has now been in custody awaiting removal for (6) months, the "presumptively reasonable" period. As one Court has observed, "while the shifting scales of reasonableness weigh heavily in favor of the authority of the Executive to detain a removable alien during the initial six-months of detention, those scales increasingly shift in favor of a detainee as the period of detention extends beyond six months and the likelihood of removal remains remote." Jabir, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 346, 2004 WL 60318, at *8. "Under the sliding scale adopted in Zadvydas, the lengthy period of petitioner's post-removal confinement has certainly caused the 'reasonably foreseeable future' to shrink to the point that removal must be truly imminent." Seretse-Khama, 215 F. Supp. 2d at 48.The record suggests substantial efforts on the part of ICE to effect removal of Petitioner, with unsubstantiated evidence of attempts to secure travel documents being made within 6 months. Under these circumstances, Petitioner has carried his initial burden of showing that, there is no significant likelihood of his removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. See Shefqet v. Ashcroft, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7075, No. 02 C 7737, 2003 WL 1964290, at *4 (N.D. III. Apr. 28, 2003) (petitioner in post-final-order detention for more than 17 months  carried burden of showing that there was no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future).
       ICE nonetheless maintains that, evidence submitted in response to Petitioner’s petition shows a significant likelihood of timely removal. This assertion is belied by the fact that more than 6 months have passed since this assertion was made, and Petitioner remains detained in the Etowah County Detention Facility. The evidence presented by the Respondents, consisting of naked data showing the number of criminal aliens successfully removed to ${sheep.nationality} for the fiscal years through 2018, is not persuasive. In this regard, other Courts have not been impressed by evidence of an arguable indication of past success in removing aliens to a particular country to establish a significant likelihood of removal of the alien in question in the reasonably foreseeable future. See, e.g., Rajigah v. Conway, 268 F. Supp. 2d 159, 167 (E.D.N.Y. 2003); Lin v. Ashcroft, 247 F. Supp. 2d 679, 686 n.9 (E.D. Pa. 2003); Shefqet, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7075, 2003 WL 1964290, at *5-6; Seretse-Khama, 215 F. Supp. 2d at 49-50. As these Courts have recognized, a statistical presentation of past successful repatriation efforts may actually undermine the government's position that, removal in a particular case will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future. Further, past success for others suggests that, there is some reason why the foreign government is refusing to accept Petitioner in question. The data presented by Respondent in this case does not indicate the number of attempted removals to ${sheep.nationality} made each year or the length of time that passed between a request for issuance of travel documents and the issuance of the documents. "Finally, while 'the history of the Service's efforts to remove aliens to the country in question' is one consideration to take into account in determining the likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future, this factor becomes increasingly less important the longer a country refuses to provide travel documents for a particular removable alien." Id. at 50. Thus, the abstract numbers presented by the Respondents in this case afford no basis for a reliable prediction that there is a significant likelihood of Petitioner removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that respondents have not shown diligence on their part to effect Petitioner’s removal. The lax efforts shown in this case "in no way support the contention that Petitioner's removal is significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future." Id.
       In summary, Petitioner has shown that there is no significant likelihood of his removal to ${sheep.nationality} in the reasonably foreseeable future. 
    In this regard, Petitioner’s burden was not to show that removal is impossible. See Shefqet, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7075, 2003 WL 1964290, at *6. Respondents have not contended that, Petitioner has failed to cooperate in effecting his removal. Moreover, respondents have not rebutted Petitioner’s showing of the absence of a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. “Although some possibility of removal may exist, Petitioner's period of post-final-order detention has been sufficiently long such that a remote, non-specific possibility [of removal] does not satisfy Respondents' burden." Id.  Accordingly, Petitioner is entitled to be released from custody, subject to appropriate conditions of supervision imposed by ICE. See Abdel-Muhti, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 430-31. An appropriate Order follows. Similarly, here, Petitioner suggests that, "neither ICE nor ${sheep.nationality} Consulate has provided any indication that ${sheep.nationality} would accept Petitioner in the reasonably foreseeable future. As noted in recent Cases, there are generally (5) circumstances where Courts have found no significant likelihood of removal in five types of Cases: (1) where the detainee is stateless and no Country will accept him; (2) where the detainee Country of origin refuses to issue a travel document; (3) where there is no repatriation agreement between the detainee’s native Country and the US;(4) where Political conditions in the Country of origin render removal virtually impossible; and (5) where a foreign Country’s delay in issuing to detainee’s is so extraordinarily long that this delay itself warrants an inference that the document will likely never issue. Basis for prong detention and ongoing nature of unlawful process towards DHS/ICE lay out basis detaining Petitioner and ongoing nature of the process towards Petitioner. 
       Petitioner has met his burden, and has solidly rebutted such showing in the reasonable foreseeable future merits. Sufficient evidence supports there no significant likelihood that Petitioner will be removed. Against this backdrop, consistent with the matters of fact and law pursuant to federal law and regulations this Court shall determine that there is no substantial likelihood of the Petitioner’s removal in the reasonably foreseeable future merits. Accordingly, due to DHS/ICE numerous failed efforts in obtaining travel documents, Petitioner’s removal is a substantial likelihood not to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; Petitioner argues that, this satisfies reasonably foreseeable future facts; Petitioner argues that, Petitioner does fall into this category. Pleadings and arguments for release in the alternative subject to supervision in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) (3) and 8 C.F.R. § 241.5. In sum, the Court finds that Petitioner has to show that removal is not "reasonable foreseeable," and moreover, any delay has been the result of DHS. Once the removal period has elapsed, the decision to continue detention is based on whether there is a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future. § 241.13 Determination of whether there is a significant likelihood of removing a detained alien in the reasonably foreseeable future. (a) Scope. 
       Finally, this section establishes special review procedures for those aliens who are subject to a final order of removal and are detained under the custody review procedures provided at § 241.4 after the expiration of the removal period, where the alien has provided good reason to believe there is no significant likelihood of removal to the country to which he or she was ordered removed, or to a third country, in the reasonably foreseeable future.`, {

Petitioner's removal therefore is not reasonable foreseeable, and his continued detention is not reasonably necessary to effect his removal. Regardless of the likelihood of prevailing on his petition for review, his removal is not significantly likely to happen in the foreseeable future because there is no time frame for a decision by the Ninth Circuit, which relied partly on the absence of a timetable for decision in Nadarajah to conclude that there was no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. See Nadarajah, 443 F.3d at 1081. Those reasons are sufficient to show that petitioner's removal is not reasonable foreseeable.
       The Government shall point out however, and that it has indeed concretely demonstrated its ability to secure ${sheep.nationality}’s permission for Petitioner's removal. To this end, the Government notes that "there is no evidence that it can obtain travel document. Under this Standard, Petitioner has met his burden under Zadvyas. Petitioner’s allegations are sufficient to demonstrate a significant unlikelihood of his removal in the reasonable foreseeable future. Additionally, the government bare and mere allegation that, the Government of ${sheep.nationality} has not declined the issuance of a travel document and ICE believes that a travel document will be secure for Petitioner and that Petitioner will be removed in the reasonable foreseeable future is a game of government manipulation ambush without any supporting evidence. See Foreign Government Response evidence. ICE bare and mere evidence allegations are insufficient to demonstrate a significant likelihood that the removal will occur, without more, DHS/ICE does not show that removal will occur in the reasonable foreseeable future. Further evidentiary development is warranted for the facts and burden needed to satisfy there is no significant likelihood that the removal will occur. Evidence reflects that there is a significant unlikelihood that Petitioner will be removed in the reasonable foreseeable future. Petitioner has established no likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future; a Petitioner must present evidence of “particular individual barriers” to his removal. DHS/ICE has diligently worked to secure a travel document for Petitioner, but unsuccessfully. See ICE Travel Request Records.  
       The Supreme Court further addressed 1231 in Zadvydas and held that 1231(a) authorizes detention for a period reasonably necessary to accomplish an alien’s removal. 533 U.S. at 701. The Supreme Court determined that six months is a presumptively reasonable period of time to allow the government to remove an alien after the removal period has commenced. Id. at 70. Once the six month period has lapsed, and “the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, [then] the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. “Id.; also Akinwale, 287 F.3d at 1052(alien must show a post-removal order detention in excess of six months” and “evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future.” Particularly relevant here, however, is that any analysis under 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) and Zadvydas is subject to 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(C), which provides that the 90-day removal period under 1231(a) may be suspended, and thereby extended, where “the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien’s departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien’s removal subject to an order of removal.” 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) (1) (C). Thus, despite the length of the Petitioner’s detention the Respondent shall determine here, it is statutorily permitted by 8 U.S.C. 1231(a) (6) so long as it remains consistent with Zadvydas and is in furtherance of the government’s legitimate interest in effecting order of removal. 
       Petitioner has satisfied the first prong of Zadvydas, his claim is included because he does “provide evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future.” Akinwale, 287 F.3dat 1052.

    doc.font('Helvetica').text(`       The statutory provision that governs the Court's review in this case is 8 U.S.C. § 1231. Under § 1231(a) (1) (A), when an alien is ordered removed the Attorney General "shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days. “During this 90-day removal period, the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") and Immigration and Customs Enforcement ("ICE") are required to detain {547 F. Supp. 2d 752} the alien. Upon the conclusion of the 90-day removal period the statute allows for either continued detention or release under supervision. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a). Although the statute gives the Attorney General the discretion to continue detaining an alien in this situation, this detention is subject to the limits of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process clause. See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-692. The 90-day POCR. None of the documents from the 90-day POCR mention the progress of ICE's efforts to obtain travel documents, the status of repatriation of Ghana nationals, or any other information that would relate to the likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. Petitioner does make a showing that his removal is unlikely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future, as required by Zadvydas in order to shift the burden to DHS to rebut that showing. Accordingly, his claim under Zadvydas has not failed. The Supreme Court decided Zadvydas, DHS promulgated regulations to implement the newly established constitutional constraints. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.4; 66 Fed. Reg. 56967, 56969 (Nov. 21, 2001) (explaining the Zadvydas decision and stating that the new regulations were issued to provide a process for DHS to determine whether there is a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future). Under the regulations, the district director is required to conduct a post-order custody review ("POCR") before the 90-day removal period expires if the alien's removal cannot be accomplished during the removal period. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.4(k) (1) (i). In conducting the POCR, officials must review the alien's records and any and all documents submitted by the alien and must inform the alien of the decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.4(h) (1).
      The 90-day POCR essentially considers three criteria: (1) flight risk; (2) danger to the community; and (3) likelihood of obtaining travel documents. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.4(e) & (f). The district director or Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office decides whether the alien is released from custody or continued in detention pending removal or further review of his or her custody status. 8 C.F.R. § 241.4(k) (1) (i). The 180-day POCR. If the alien is not released or removed at the time of the initial POCR and has cooperated with the removal process, he or she must receive a second review three months later, or after 180 days have passed from the date the removal period began. 8 C.F.R. § 241.4(k) (2) (ii). The 180-day review is conducted by the HQPDU and considers whether there is a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.13. If an alien is not likely to be removed in {547 F. Supp. 2d 753} the reasonable foreseeable future he or she may still be detained if the alien meets one of four "special circumstance" criteria. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.14. The 180-day determination looks at whether it is reasonable to believe that travel documents can be obtained, given the federal government's efforts, the receiving country's willingness to facilitate the process, and other factors. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.4(e) & (f). 
    There is no specific time-period for removal when the DHS is actively attempting to remove the alien; however the government's prospects for a timely removal must be reasonable under the circumstances in order to continue detention beyond 180-days.
      Finally, if the HQPDU determines that removal is not likely in the foreseeable future, the alien must be released unless his continued detention is justified by a special circumstance. A Court-granted stay of removal or an alien's failure to comply with removal efforts can extend detention indefinitely and remove an alien from the POCR review process.`, {

    doc.font('Helvetica').text(`       The Supreme Court held that, to state a claim under § 2241, the alien must show that he has been detained beyond the six-month presumptively reasonable period, and must provide good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701. Specifically, the Supreme Court determined:  After this 6-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. And for detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior post removal confinement grows, what counts as the "reasonably foreseeable future" conversely would have to shrink. This 6-month presumption, of course, does not mean that every alien not removed must be released after six months. 
       To the contrary, an alien may be held in confinement until it has been determined that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.
       In Benitez's case, the District Court for the Northern District of Florida also concluded that removal would not occur in the "foreseeable future," but nonetheless denied the petition. Supra Benitez v Wallis, Case No. 5:02cv19 MMP (July 11, 2002), pp. 2, 4, App. in {543 U.S. 377} No. 03-7434, pp. 45, 48.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the dissent in Xi. 337 F.3d 1289 (2003).  The Court granted certiorari in both cases. Supra Benitez v. Mata, 540 U.S. 1147, 157 L. Ed. 2d 966, 124 S. Ct. 1143 (2004); Crawford v. Martinez, 540 U.S. 1217, 158 L. Ed. 2d 152, 124 S. Ct. 1507 (2004).The Court held that "if removal is not reasonably foreseeable," then "continued detention . . . [is] no longer authorized by [the] statute. The Court then went one step further and adopted a six-month presumption: "After [a] [six]-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing." Id. at 701. In Zadvydas, the Supreme Court interpreted this post-removal provision of § 1231 to include a presumptively reasonable detention period of six months. 533 U.S. at 701. In reaching this result, the Supreme Court explained that the six-month presumption did not mean that every alien must automatically be placed on supervised release at the end of six months; rather, the Court made clear that confinement may continue beyond this period until "it has been determined that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future." Id. Thus, under Zadvydas, an alien detained while awaiting removal cannot obtain habeas relief from continued confinement unless he meets a two prong standard. The alien must show (i) that he is being held beyond the presumptively reasonable six-month period, and (ii) that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future. See Phillippe v. Willett, No. 1:08cv1167 (JCC), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12416, 2009 WL 416053, at *4 (E.D. Va. Feb. 18, 2009). If the alien makes these prima facie showings, the burden shifts to the government to provide evidence in rebuttal. See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.
       The Courts have found that removal was not "reasonable foreseeable" in situations where no country would accept the detainee, the country of origin refused to issue proper travel documents, the United States and the country of origin did not have a removal agreement in place, or the country to which the deportee was going to be removed was unresponsive for a significant period of time. See Nma, 286 F. Supp. 2d at 475. None of these circumstances are analogous to the facts presented here. Title 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) (6) provides, in relevant part, as follows: By its terms, this provision applies to three categories of aliens: (1) those ordered removed who are inadmissible under § 1182, (2) those ordered removed who are removable under § 1227(a)(1)(C), § 1227(a)(2), or § 1227(a)(4), and (3) those ordered removed whom the Secretary determines to be either a risk to the community or a flight risk.  In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001), the Court interpreted this provision to authorize the Attorney General (now the Secretary) to detain aliens in the second category only as long as "reasonably necessary" to remove them from the country.   Id., at 689, 699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.
    The statute's use of "may," the Court said, "Suggests discretion," but "not necessarily . . . Unlimited discretion. In that respect the word 'may' is ambiguous."  Id., at 697, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.  In light of that perceived ambiguity and the "serious constitutional threat" the Court believed to be posed by indefinite detention of aliens who had been admitted to the country, id., at 699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491, the Court interpreted the statute to permit only detention that is related to the statute's "basic purpose [of] effectuating an alien's removal,"   id., at 696-699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.  {543 U.S. 378} "[O]nce removal is no longer reasonable foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized."  Id., at 699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.  The Court further held that the presumptive period during which the detention of an alien is reasonably necessary to effectuate his removal is six months; after that, the alien is eligible for conditional release if he can demonstrate that there is "no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable {160 L. Ed. 2d 745} future."  Id., at 701, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.`, {

Supra Government of Canal Zone v. Brooks, 427 F.2d 346, 347 (5th {547 F. Supp. 2d 756} Cir. 1970).

Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 65 S. Ct. 1443, 89 L. Ed. 2103 (1945). The regulations involved here do not merely facilitate internal agency housekeeping, but rather afford important and imperative procedural safeguards to detainees. See United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741, 760, 99 S. Ct. 1465, 59 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1979). This Court must insist on DHS's compliance with the post-order custody regulations if Petitioner's detention is to remain constitutional. Id. (noting that the Supreme Court has insisted on forcing agency compliance with their own regulations when the regulations afford individual rights and protections).The Court is well aware of the executive branch's primacy in this area of law. The Supreme Court has said that "judicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the Immigration context where officials 'exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations. '" Supra INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S. Ct. 1439, 143 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1999) (quoting Immigration & Naturalization Service v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S. Ct. 904, 99 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1988)). Nevertheless, the judiciary is the final authority on issues of constitutionality and statutory construction and must reject administrative actions that violate the constitution or laws of the nation.
      Finally, it is important to emphasize that the Court here is not reviewing and reversing the manner in which agency discretion was exercised, but is instead dealing with DHS's failure to exercise its discretion altogether and provide aliens with the applicable process contrary to valid existing regulations. See Accardi, 347 U.S. at 268. As the Supreme Court has made clear, there is a "strong tradition in habeas corpus law" that subjects an agency's failure to exercise discretion, unlike an agency's unwise exercise of given discretion, to habeas corpus review. See I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 307, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (2001) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Detention beyond the removal period may be maintained only upon compliance with applicable process. For aliens ordered removed like Petitioner, that process is specified in 8 C.F.R. § 241.4 and § 241.13. As the Supreme Court warned in Zadvydas, serious constitutional problems arise when § 1231 permits indefinite deprivation of human liberty without procedural safeguards. See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 692. The regulations promulgated in response to Zadvydas aim to provide such safeguards. DHS cannot constitutionally continue to detain the Petitioner without complying with the procedures laid out in the regulations.`, {

Section 241.14(f) (1) provides:  Subject to the review procedures provided in this section, DHS shall continue to detain an alien if the release of the alien would pose a special danger to the public, because:(i) The alien has previously committed one or more serious Crimes of Violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. 16;(ii) Due to a mental condition or personality disorder and behavior associated with that condition or disorder, the alien is likely to engage in acts of violence in the future; and(iii) No condition of release can reasonably be expected to ensure the safety of the public.      
      Petitioner's continued detention is not authorized pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §241.14(f), and that this regulation is not a reasonable and permissible post-decision interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) (6), which allows for continued detention for aliens who are a risk to the community.

Md. 2010) (holding that agency's regulation carving out exception to release of aliens unlikely to be removed if they were especially dangerous was reasonable interpretation of statute authorizing alien's detention beyond ninety days, and was entitled to deference, and the regulation supported detention). The Court agrees. As Respondent aptly states, and the Court agrees, if the Government could remove Petitioner to his native ${sheep.nationality}, it would. Diplomatic relations between the United States and ${sheep.nationality} is by-case-bases, there has yet to be an established process whereby ICE can remove and repatriate Ghana nationals with final orders of removal. Thus, until a new Migration Accord is not negotiated, Petitioner is not removable. In the interim, Petitioner has not been afforded due process in accordance with 8 C.F.R. §241.14 and his detention remains unlawful under 8 U.S.C. §1231. Petitioner is subject to a final order of removal as a result of his Criminal conduct. 
    His detention was reviewed under 8 C.F.R. §241.14(f) after the new regulation was promulgated in 2001 in response to Zadvydas. ICE determined that, based on the unlikelihood of his removal, a review of his Criminal and disciplinary history. Detention of aliens during the Immigration Removal process is governed by two separate Statutory provisions: The first -- Section 236 of the INA, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1226 -- authorizes the arrest and detention of an alien "pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed." The second -- Section 241(a) of the INA, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) -- comes into play "when an alien is ordered removed." In the parlance of the Statutes and relevant Case law, Section 1231(a) governs during the "removal period," which begins, inter alia, on the latest of either of the following: (i) the date the order of removal becomes administratively final. (ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court's final order.8 U.S.C. § 1231(a) (1) (B).
      Finally, as the Court will discuss, see infra pp. In cases such as the Courts, the precise edges of the removal period are somewhat difficult to demarcate. Thus, the Court takes the time now to discuss both Section 1226 and Section 1231(a) detentions at some length. The Court address the removal period before the pre-removal-order context -- although this may at first seem out-of-order -- in light of the chronology of important Supreme Court precedent surrounding these subjects.`, {

Supra E.g., Lora v. Shanahan, 804 F.3d 601, 610-13 (2d Cir. 2015); Sylvain, 714 F.3d at 161, supra (3d Cir.); Hosh v. Lucero, 680 F.3d 375, 378-83 (4th Cir. 2012); see also Castañeda v.

      Only one half of an equally-divided en banc panel, out of the First Circuit, has endorsed Petitioner's view that the Government cannot exercise Mandatory Detention if it fails to immediately detain an alien upon his release. See id. The undersigned finds the reasoning of the Second, Third, and Fourth Circuits to be more persuasive. 
    As the Fourth Circuit pointed out, nothing in § 1231 suggests that the Government forfeits its authority to mandatorily detain a qualified alien if the Government fails to exercise that authority immediately upon the alien's release from custody. Hosh, 680 F.3d at 381-83; id. at 381 ("a statute directing official action needs more than a mandatory 'shall' before the grant of power can sensibly be read to expire when the job is supposed to be done.") (quoting Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 161, 123 S. Ct. 748, 154 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2003)). Moreover, the Second and Third Circuits have addressed, and rejected, the argument that mandatory detention under § 1231 applies only to aliens released from a sentence of imprisonment. Supra Lora, 804 F.3d at 609-10; Sylvain, 714 F.3d at 161.    
      Finally, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has also expressed doubt about this argument. Supra Olmos v. Holder, 780 F.3d 1313, 1327 (10th Cir. 2015) (citing In re Kotliar, 24 I. & N. Dec. 124, 125 (B.I.A. 2007); In re West, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1405, 1410 (B.I.A. 2000); Sylvain, 714 F.3d at 161). As the Lora Court pointed out, the text of § 1226(c) "clearly contemplates non-carceral sentences," and Congress did not limit mandatory detention only to aliens who received a sentence of imprisonment. 804 F.3d at 610.

    doc.font('Helvetica').text(`       The length of his detention under § 1231, without having received a bond hearing, has grown unreasonably long, in violation of his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. Petitioner finds considerable merit to this argument, and respectfully recommends that Petitioner is substantially likely to succeed on the merits of this claim. The Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process in deportation proceedings. Supra Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1993). "[T]he Due Process Clause applies to all 'persons' within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent." Supra Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693, 121 S. Ct. 2491, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2001).
       As a general matter, the Supreme Court has upheld the Constitutionality of Mandatory Pre-Removal Detention for that subset of aliens identified in § 1231, whom Congress has determined categorically to pose a risk of flight or dangerousness. Supra Demore, 538 U.S. at 513; see also id. at 517-21 (describing the problem of criminal aliens evading removal by failing to appear at deportation proceedings). The Supreme Court held "that Congress justifiably concerned that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers, may require that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings." Id. at 513 (emphasis added). Congress could, consistent with due process, require the brief detention of certain aliens under § 1231 pending completion of removal proceedings, without affording them individualized bond hearings, by relying on a blanket presumption of flight and dangerousness based on the crime for which the alien has been convicted. Supra Chavez-Alvarez v. Warden, York City. Prison, 783 F.3d 469, 473 (3d Cir. 2015) (discussing Demore, among other Cases).
       In sustaining the Constitutionality of Mandatory Detention under § 1231, however, the Supreme Court expressly relied on the assumption that mandatory detention has a "definite termination point." Id. at 529. The Supreme Court also relied on a body of statistics showing that, in the majority of Cases, Mandatory Detention lasts less than 90 days. Id. at 529-30; see also Diop v. ICE/ Dep't of Homeland Security, 656 F.3d 221, 233 (3d Cir. 2011) ("Demore emphasized that mandatory detention pursuant to § 1231 lasts only for a 'very limited time' in the vast majority of cases.") (citing Demore, 538 U.S. at 529 & n.12). The Supreme Court recounted these figures as follows: 
       The Executive Office for Immigration Review has calculated that, in 85% of the cases in which aliens are detained pursuant to § 1231, removal proceedings are completed in an average time of 47 days and a median of 30 days. In the remaining 15% of Cases, in which the alien appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals, appeal takes an average of four months, with a median time that is slightly shorter. Id., at 40.These statistics do not include the many cases in which removal proceedings are completed while the alien is still serving time for the underlying conviction. Id., at 40, n. 17. In a concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote to observe that, while pre-removal detention without a bond hearing is constitutional, it can grow so long that it violates Due Process. Id. at 531-33 (Kennedy, J., concurring). "[S]ince the Due Process Clause prohibits arbitrary deprivations of liberty; a lawful permanent resident alien... could be entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention became unreasonable or unjustified." Id. at 532 (citing Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 684-86, 121 S. Ct. 2491, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2001)).
       Subsequently, every Circuit Court of Appeals to have addressed the issue has held that due process imposes a limit on how long the Government can detain an alien under § 1226(c) before it must afford him a bond hearing. E.g., Lora, 804 F.3d at 613-17; Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1138 (9th Cir. 2013) ("Consistent with our previous decisions, the Court conclude that, to avoid constitutional concerns, § 1226(c)'s mandatory language must be construed 'to contain an implicit "reasonable time" limitation, the application of which is subject to federal-court review.'") (quoting Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 682); Diop, 656 F.3d at 233 ("In short, when detention [under § 1231] becomes unreasonable, the Due Process Clause demands a hearing, at which the Government bears the burden of proving that continued detention is necessary to fulfill the purposes of the detention statute."); see also Ly v. Hansen, 351 F.3d 263, 268 (6th Cir. 2003) ("Therefore, we hold that the INS may detain prima facie removable aliens for a time reasonable required to complete removal proceedings in a timely manner. If the process takes an unreasonable long time, the detainee may seek relief in habeas proceedings."). Thus, the Constitutionality of [mandatory detention] is a function of the length of the detention. At a certain point, continued detention becomes unreasonable and the Executive Branch's implementation of § 1231 becomes unconstitutional unless the Government has justified its actions at a hearing inquiring into whether continued detention is consistent with the law's purposes of preventing flight and dangers to the community. Diop, 656 F.3d at 232 (footnote omitted).
       The only difference among these Circuits is how to measure whether mandatory detention has grown unreasonably long.
       Petitioner raises that the Second and Ninth Circuits have adopted a "bright-line" test, holding that an alien's mandatory detention becomes presumptively unreasonable after six months, at which point the Government can no longer justify further detention without making an individualized showing that the alien is a flight risk or a danger to the community. Lora, 804 F.3d at 614-15, 616; Rodriguez, 715 F.3d at 1137-38 (concluding that, in order to avoid constitutional concerns, § 1231 contains an implicit temporal limit on mandatory detention, which is reached at the six-month mark). The Second Circuit provided a number of reasons for adopting the bright-line approach: (1) the Supreme Court itself "has recognized that bright-line rules provide clear guidance and ease of administration to government officials," id. at 615, including in the context of post-removal detention, where the Supreme Court adopted a six-month rule "for the sake of uniform administration" and limiting the need for lower courts to make difficult judgments, id. (quoting Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 700-01); (2) where large immigration dockets exist, a case-by-case approach would be unworkable, id. at 615-16; and (3) "without a six-month rule, endless months of detention, often caused by nothing more than bureaucratic backlog, has real-life consequences for Immigrants and their families,".
       The Third and Sixth Circuits, by contrast, have adopted a case-by-case approach. E.g., Diop, 656 F.3d at 233; Ly, 351 F.3d at 271. Petitioner argues that as the Third Circuit put it, "due process requires us to recognize that, at a certain point ­ which may differ case by case ­ the burden to an alien's liberty outweighs a mere presumption that the alien will flee and/or is dangerous." Chavez-Alvarez, 783 F.3d at 474-75. A Court's task is to weigh the goals of the mandatory detention statute against the personal costs to the alien's liberty. Id. at 475. The various factors these Courts consider include: The individual detainee's need for more or less time, Diop, 656 F.3d at 234; the exigencies of a particular case, id.; whether errors in the Immigration proceedings have caused delay, id.; and the length of the alien's detention relative to how long Congress and the Supreme Court contemplated mandatory detention lasting, id. at 234-35. With respect to the last factor, the Third Circuit stated: [W]e note that the reasonableness of any given detention pursuant to § 1226(c) is a function of whether it is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the Statute, and, given that Congress and the Supreme Court believed those purposes would be fulfilled in the vast majority of cases within a month and a half, and five months at the maximum, see Demore, 538 U.S. at 530, 123 S. Ct. 1708, the constitutional case for continued detention without inquiry into its necessity becomes more and more suspect as detention continues past those thresholds. Id. at 234. Additional factors include whether "the Government was responsible for creating unreasonable delays," Chavez-Alvarez, 783 F.3d at 475 (citing Diop, 656 F.3d at 234); the conditions of the alien's confinement, id. at 478; whether the alien has contributed to the delay, Ly, 351 F.3d at 272; and whether the alien is ultimately removable, because if not (for example, due to the lack of a repatriation treaty with the destination country), mandatory detention cannot further the goal of deportation, id. at 271-72.`, {

    doc.font('Helvetica').text(`      Indeed, Petitioner does question the lawfulness and Constitutionality of his detention since his removal order become final. However, continuing to the present and projecting into the future – this Court finally shall arrive at the question at the heart of the petition before this Court: Whether Petitioner’s detention by DHS offends due process of law under the reasonableness analysis set forth in Zadvydas and post-Demore Case-law and, thereby, under the statutory authorization for Immigration detentions under either Section 1226 (c) or Section 1231(a). The Court answers this question in the negative, with the caveat that the Court dismissed the petition without prejudice to renewal as described below. For the benefit of the reader, the Court restates what their analysis entails. If Petitioner "provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonable foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing." Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701; see also Abimbola, 181 F. App'x at 99. "[I]f removal is not reasonable foreseeable, the court should hold continued detention unreasonable and no longer authorized by statute." Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 700-01. In this Case, this Court is presented with a two-part factual inquiry: (1) whether Petitioner's continued detention, resulting from his own seeking of a review; and (2) whether, in the event Petitioner's challenge fails and he is ultimately ordered removed by DHS, there is good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood that the Government will be able to deport Petitioner back to ${sheep.nationality} in the reasonable foreseeable future.

INS, 329 F.3d 1057 (9th Cir. 2003), from which the Government quotes the following language: "The reason is self-evident: the detainee cannot convincingly argue that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future if the detainee controls the clock." (Opp. Mem. 8 (quoting Pelich, 329 F.3d at 1060)). "Accordingly," the Government writes, "the risk of indefinite detention that motivated the Supreme Court's statutory interpretation in Zadvydas does not exist here, as Zheng 'have the keys [to freedom] in his pocket' by declining to seek stays of removal." (Opp. Mem. 8-9 (quoting Pelich, 329 F.3d at 1060)). However, is startlingly distinguishable from the habeas petition before the Court. In Pelich -- while also seeking release from Immigration detention -- was well past his ability to seek judicial or administrative challenges to his removal. 329 F.3d at 1058. Indeed, he had waived his right to appeal the Immigration judge's order of removal. Id. Instead, Petitioner in that case simply refused to cooperate with Immigration officials' efforts to deport him. Id. at 1058-59."Pelich himself is responsible for his plight," the Ninth Circuit wrote, because he refused to fill out a passport application and, when prompted, provided "conflicting information regarding his name, his parents' names, his parents' birthplaces and residences, his birthplace and his nationality." Id. at 1059. The "keys to freedom" in Pelich were, therefore, quite unlike those in this case.
       In Pelich does not stand for the permissibility of detention for Petitioners in the course of their removal challenges -- indeed; the Ninth Circuit is arguably the most Petitioner-friendly Court of Appeals in this corner of the law. See generally Rodriguez, 715 F.3d at 1139.that Court holds that "Immigration detention becomes prolonged at the six-month mark regardless of the authorizing statute... [and] that conclusion is consistent with the reasoning of Zadvydas [and] Demore." Id.

See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 684-86; see also Monestime, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 458 ("Because of the recent catastrophe in Haiti, [petitioner] faces a likelihood of indefinite detention by ICE.").
